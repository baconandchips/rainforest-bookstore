# Learnings:
- Debugging legacy tutorial. Resolved a bug that caused months' worth of learners to not be able to progress, and summarized learnings of bug replication and resolution in a comment on the tutorial.
- Enhanced knowledge around AWS technology. Dug into Stackoverflow and documentation in order to resolve the above bug, and cross-referenced various sources to improve my own understandings.
- Improved understanding of GraphQL. Read documentation to augment my own knowledge.
