## Learnings:
- Debugging legacy tutorial. Resolved a bug that caused months' worth of learners to not be able to progress, and summarized learnings of bug replication and resolution in a comment on the tutorial.

- Deployed site on AWS S3, with AWS Amplify.
- Handle payments through Stripe API.
- Improved understanding of GraphQL. Read documentation to augment my own knowledge.
